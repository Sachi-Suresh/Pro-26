First rinse and shred or chop all the veggies, then set aside. You will need 1 cup shredded cabbage, ½ shredded carrots, 8 to 10 french beans (thinly sliced or finely chopped), ⅓ sliced capsicum and ⅓ cup chopped spring onion whites.

Increase the quantity of veggies according to your preferences. Add some cremini or button mushrooms if you like.
 Next heat 5 to 6 cups of water in a pan.

Then when the water comes to a boil, add ½ teaspoon salt.

Next add ½ teaspoon oil and mix well. Add any neutral oil.

Then add the noodles (about 200 grams). I have used whole wheat noodles. The recipe is customizable with any noodles – instant, ramen, soba, chow mein, udon, rice.

Cook the noodles you will be using according to the package instructions as every variety of noodle will have a different cooking time.

For any variety of noodle, you need to cook them until al dente.
Now boil until the noodles are cooked al dente.
Be sure to check the doneness throughout the noodles recipe by pressing a few noodles or tasting them. They should be softened, but still have a slight bite to them.

Then drain the cooked noodles in a colander or sieve.
Next rinse the noodles with fresh water.
After that, set aside. You can even toss the noodles recipe with 2 to 3 teaspoons oil if desired.

Now heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil in a wok or pan. Keep the heat to low or medium-low. Add 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic and 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger.

Swap toasted sesame oil with any neutral oil or olive oil.
